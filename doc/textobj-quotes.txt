INTRODUCTION                                                *textobj-quotes*

|vim-textobj-quotes| is a Vim plugin providing text objects for the closest
pairs of quotes of any type. Using only |iq| or |aq| it allows you to operate
on content of single quotes, double quotes, or back ticks that currently
surround the cursor, are in front of the cursor, or behind (in that order of
preference).  In other words, it jumps forward or backwards when needed to
reach the quotes.

It's easier to understand by looking at examples (the cursor is shown with `|`):

1. Before: foo '1, |2, 3' bar; after pressing |diq|: foo '|' bar
2. Before: foo| '1, 2, 3' bar; after pressing |diq|: foo '|' bar
3. Before: foo '1, 2, 3' |bar; after pressing |diq|: foo '|' bar
4. Before: foo '1, |2, 3' bar; after pressing |daq|: foo | bar
5. Before: foo| '1, 2, 3' bar; after pressing |daq|: foo | bar
6. Before: foo '1, 2, 3' |bar; after pressing |daq|: foo | bar

The examples above are given for single quotes, the plugin works exactly the
same way for double quotes and back ticks (`).

The plugin uses |vim-textobj-user| developed by Kana Natsuno and requires it to
be installed: https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user

MAPPINGS                                           *textobj-quotes-mappings*

By default the pluging provides |iq| and |aq| mappings to operate on the
content surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, or back ticks.

As most of the time, you need to operate on a text inside quotes, I add the
following binding to make it even more convenient to use:
>
  onoremap q iq
>
Now, you just need to press |cq|, |dq|, |yq|, or |vq| to operate on the text
in single quotes, double quotes, or back ticks nearby without manually moving
into them.
